# LangGraph Academy Course Notes and Code Walkthrough

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains comprehensive notes and code explanations from the **LangGraph Academy Course**. I have enhanced the provided materials with additional insights and detailed explanations to guide you through each step.

## About the Course Notes

This project is designed to:
- Provide detailed, step-by-step explanations for each concept covered in the LangGraph Academy Course.
- Supplement the original notes with expanded content for deeper understanding.
- Allow users to run the code directly in Google Colab by simply copying the link, making it easy to follow along and experiment.

## Getting Started

To use this code:
1. **Copy the link** of a specific file you want to explore.
2. **Paste the link in Google Colab** â€“ it will automatically import the code, allowing you to run and modify it as you go.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Google account to access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Familiarity with Python and basic concepts of LangGraph will be helpful.

## Usage

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Paste the copied link into the **"Open notebook"** section.
3. Execute each cell to follow along with the notes and explanations.

## Structure

- **Concepts:** Each section covers a key concept in LangGraph, along with practical examples.
